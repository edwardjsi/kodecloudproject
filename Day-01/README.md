# Day 01 – Configuration Management with Ansible

## Goal
Understand why Configuration Management is needed and justify choosing Ansible over Puppet using real-world reasoning.

## What I did
- Studied the need for Configuration Management to ensure consistent application configuration across multiple servers and operating systems.
- Compared Ansible and Puppet based on agent model, execution model, language, and communication protocol.
- Documented the decision to use Ansible and created a conceptual inventory file with logical server groupings.

## What this proves
- I understand infrastructure problems caused by ad-hoc scripts and configuration drift.
- I can evaluate tools based on operational impact, not popularity.
- I know how Ansible inventories are structured and used in real environments.

## How this helps a client/employer
- I can standardize server configurations across environments reliably.
- I can reduce operational overhead by using agentless configuration management.
- I can design clear, scalable inventories for managing large fleets of servers.
